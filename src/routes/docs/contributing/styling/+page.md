# Styling

This framework leverages Tailwind, PostCSS and a combination of BEM-like CSS with utility class organization. This framework does not use CSS-in-JS as we want the components' styling to be easily overwritten, if desired. The separation of concerns, component structure and component styling, is important for flexibility and theming.
