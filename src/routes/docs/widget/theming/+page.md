# Theming

The widget can be themed quite easily through a [Tailwind configuration file](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration). There is also a light and [dark mode for the default theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode). Below, we will show you how to utilize these features.

## Dark mode

Taking advantage of the Widget's light and dark mode is simple. We use [Tailwind's optional `<body>` class](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) to trigger the mode. You can manually add `tw_dark` to the `<body>` element to "force" dark mode.

```html
<body class="tw_dark"></body>
```

Or, you can programmatically do it like this:

```html
<body>
  <script>
    const prefersDarkTheme = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches;
    if (prefersDarkTheme) {
      document.body.classList.add('tw_dark');
    }
  </script>
  <!-- Rest of HTML -->
</body>
```

## Theme configuration

The Login Widget uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as its styling library. [Reconfiguring the theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) to use different colors, fonts and sizing is done through providing new values to the [configuration file](https://github.com/cerebrl/forgerock-web-login-framework/blob/main/tailwind.config.cjs) and rebuilding the Widget.

### Steps

1. Clone the [ForgeRock Web Login Framework](https://github.com/cerebrl/forgerock-web-login-framework)
2. Install the npm dependencies: `npm i`
3. Run the development script: `npm run dev`
4. Run Storybook to view your changes: `npm run storybook`
5. Open the `tailwind.config.cjs` file and adjust your theme via the `extend` property

As an example, let's say you wanted to lighten the body color for _only_ the light mode and use a burnt orange shade as the primary color for both light and dark.

```js
// tailwind.config.cjs
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,svelte,ts}', './.storybook/preview-head.html'],
  darkMode: 'class',
  presets: [require('./themes/default/config.cjs')],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        body: {
          light: '#e2e8f0',
        },
        primary: {
          dark: '#a16207',
          light: '#92400e',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

To safely adjust the theme's styling, we recommend using the base properties (what we call "tokens") found in our default theme in [the `/theme/default/tokens.cjs` file](https://github.com/cerebrl/forgerock-web-login-framework/blob/main/themes/default/tokens.cjs). But, do not directly modify the `/theme` files, only modify the values in the root `tailwind.config.cjs` file in order to preserve your upgrade path.

> NOTE: Technically, any theme setting that's configurable in the Tailwind library is configurable in the Widget, but do so with caution as there may be side-effects to reconfiguring the core, underlying values that could be hard to overcome.

### Supported customization

Currently, the recommended values to customize are grouped to the following:

1. Colors
2. Fonts
3. Type sizes
4. Spacing
5. Breakpoints
