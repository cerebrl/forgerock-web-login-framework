# ForgeRock { data.framework.name }

## WARNING: BETA VERSION

**This is a early preview ({ data.package.version }) of a development framework for generating a JavaScript { data.package.name } for use within an existing self-hosted SPA (React, Vue, Angular, etc.). Eventually, this same framework will also generate a standalone ForgeRock { data.app.name} for self-hosting. This project is not yet officially supported and is not recommended for any project development. If you use this, you accept all the risks that come with completely unsupported software.**

Note: As of Beta.6, the API has gone under a dramatic refactoring. Please pay close attention to the API changes if you were using Beta.5 or earlier.

## Summary

The { data.package.name } produced by this framework is intended to be an all-inclusive, UI component that can be installed within any modern JavaScript app for handling the default login, registration and related user flows. It can be used within a React, Vue, Angular or any other modern JavaScript framework (does not currently support Node.js or server-rendering (SSR)).

## ForgeRock { data.package.name }

The Login Widget, currently in beta, is an embeddable JavaScript component that requires no "runtime" UI libraries or frameworks, allowing it to be used within a React, Angular, Vue, etc. application without any additional dependencies.

This Widget helps you easily integrate your existing or new apps with the ForgeRock platform and its journeys. It supports the rendering of the built-in nodes and their corresponding callbacks within authentication and self-service journeys. [Please see our "Roadmap" section for current limitations and planned features](/docs/widget/roadmap).

[Please visit our "Widget Docs" for the quick-start and full API documentation](/docs/widget).

## ForgeRock { data.app.name }

This is a future proposal that would leverage this framework to produce an independent, customizable application for self-hosting, in addition to producing the Login Widget. This Login App would be recommended for use in building a custom, self-hosted, centralized login experience. Let us know if this is of interest to you.

## What is "The Framework"?

The "framework" refers to the underlying tech responsible for producing the products (the ForgeRock { data.package.name }, for example) intended for use by our customers. This tech is composed of the development framework (SvelteKit), theming library (Tailwind), bundling (Rollup/Vite), localization, testing (Playwright). This can be downloaded and modified to produce custom versions of the { data.package.name } that can be used in place of the out-of-the-box product.
