# Overview

If you'd like to contribute to the development of this framework, you'll need to be familiar with the following:

- TypeScript/ES6+
- Node
- NPM
- Svelte & SvelteKit
- Tailwind
- ForgeRock AM or Identity Cloud
- ForgeRock trees/journeys, nodes and their associated callbacks
- Authentication, authorization, sessions & OAuth/OIDC

## Technical requirements

1. Node.js v16 (full support of v18 coming soon)
2. npm v8 or higher

## Knowledge requirements

1. JavaScript & TypeScript
2. Svelte
3. Tailwind
4. ES Modules

## Install, build & run

1. `npm install` (or simply `npm i`)
2. `npm run dev` (leave running)

This will install all the necessary dependencies, build the project and run it in `dev` mode, providing you with Hot Module Reloading. This will also produce the Widget package for use in external applications.
